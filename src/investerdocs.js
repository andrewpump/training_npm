Fear (21-40): A fear level in the index indicates that there is still pessimism in the market, but not at the extreme levels seen during panic selling.

Neutral (41-60): When the index is in the neutral range, it suggests that the market sentiment is balanced, and there is no overwhelming fear or greed prevailing.

Greed (61-80): A greed level indicates that investors are exhibiting higher optimism and enthusiasm about the market. It might be a sign of a potential overbought market, and caution is advised.
